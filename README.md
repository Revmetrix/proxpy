# proxpy

proxpy is a HTTP/HTTPS Proxy server written in Python by Roberto Paleari and Alessandro Reina. The original source code can be found [here on google code] (http://code.google.com/p/proxpy/).

My project [walker] (https://github.com/yeukhon/walker) needs a proxy server to 
intercepts the requests and responses between the client and the server. I find
proxypy handy to hack on and works for my purpose so I decided to adopt this
as my main proxy. 

As a git / hg user, I decided to conver the original SVN repository to a git
repoistory using svn2git tool. All commit history should be perserved.
